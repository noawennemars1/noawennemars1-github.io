            <h2>The assignment</h2>
            <span>
                <p>During my internship at DPG Media, I got the question whether I would be willing to give a presentation on how to improve the accessibility of the apps of De Volkskrant and other DPG brands. Throughout my education, I noticed that accessibility was becoming increasingly important, but I had not focused on it much until then. I saw this as an ultimate opportunity to learn more about the subject. My immediate reaction was yes, but I told them: “Give me some time to delve into this subject and I’ll do it!” By following a masterclass from the Accessibility foundation, interviewing visually impaired people and a visit to the muZIEum museum in Nijmegen I dove into accessibility. During my dive into this subject, I focused on visual limitations. I didn’t have the time to touch other fields within this subject.</p>

            <h3>My role and working with others</h3>
            <h4>My role</h4>
            <p>My role in particular was being the researcher. For example, I spoke with an expert working at the Accessibility Foundation, visually impaired people and presented all of my insights to the team I did my internship at.</p>        
            <p>My goal was to leave a mark and make accessibility an important subject during the rest of the year.</p>
            <h4>The audience of the presentation</h4>
            <p>The audience I presented my insights for excisted out of people from the product team. The team exists out of UX designers, researchers, iOS, Android and Web developers. But also the Head of Product, Product Owners and other leading staff joined the presentation.</p>

            <h2>Final result</h2>
            <p>The information from all of the research formed the foundation for my presentation. One of the interviewed people also helped me with the presentation. She attended to elaborate more and make my more complete. I really enjoyed doing the presentation. During my internship, I also took a course on presenting, so I was able to apply that knowledge at that moment. I think I did leave an impression with the presentation. The whole process was a great time for me, where I could use my curiosity in a fun way to explore a new area for me.</p>

            <h2>Process</h2>
            <h3>1. Masterclass by the Accessibility foundation</h3>
            <span>
                <p>To get an introduction to the subject, I signed up for a masterclass conducted by the Accessibility foundation. The masterclass was divided into two evenings. There, I learned about the fundamentals of accessibility in general and on the web. The first evening of the masterclass consisted of listening to information and asking questions to the expert. This already provided a lot of insight. On the second evening, we got hands-on experience evaluating a website. I learned how to examine a website to analyze it.</p>

                </figure>
            </span>
            <h3>2. Feedback</h3>
            <p>After the masterclass I stayed in contact with the teachter from the masterclass. He gave me tips and feedback on how to make the presentation more memorable to the audience. </p>
            <h3>3. Interviewing visually impaired people </h3>
            <span>
                <p>After the masterclass, I wanted to learn more. That's why I decided that I wanted to conduct interviews with several visually impaired individuals. Through my network, I found four people who were willing to assist me. I spoke with them and immediately noticed that a visual impairment brings more challenges than I initially thought. It provided me with a clear insight into how the online world is still not fully navigable for blind and visually impaired individuals.</p>

                </figure>
            </span>
            <h3>4. Visiting the muZIEum</h3>
            <span>
                <p>I'm not Tripadvisor, but in my opinion, the MuZIEum is a must-visit in Nijmegen. The dark experience I had there truly allowed me to understand what it's like to be blind. The friendly guide was able to personally assist us with any questions we had. They shared their own experiences, which were confirmed by the experience itself at the same time. The dark experience involved walking through dark rooms with certain setups using a guide stick. I don't want to give away too much about how it felt, but after this experience, I gained a clear understanding of the daily life of someone with visual impairments. After the dark experience, I wrote a postcard in braille. That’s what is illustrated in the picture.</p>

        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Reflecting on the process</h2>
            <p>This project was a real eye-opening process (pun intended). The presentation left a noticable mark with the team. If I had two more weeks, I’d interview more people and make examples on how to improve the UX design to show the audience how it could be. </p>
