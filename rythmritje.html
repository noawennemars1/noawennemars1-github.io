                        The problem
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        The ArenAPoort area in the South-East of Amsterdam houses three large event venues. It experiences extremely high traffic levels during peak periods just before and after events. On occasions when three events concur, more than 150,000 people commute to and from the area, with over half of the visitors travel by car. This results into a significant increase in emissions. Many visitors choose to use cars either out of habit or due to lack of alternative options. Traffic congestion is the downside for visitors traveling by car, as their motto is "the faster the travel, the better." This is where Rythm Ritje comes into play for concertgoers.

                    <h4>
                        The concept and the app
                    </h4>
                    <p>
                        With Rythm Ritje, visitors park farther away from the venue and bike from the parking lot to the concert. This reduces the amount of time visitors spend in traffic. The route you take depends on where you're coming from, allowing you to travel most efficiently and avoid traffic. In the app, visitors can manage their parking ticket, reserve bicycles, and prepare for the concert. As preparation, you can listen to music from the artist you're going to see and get outfit inspiration. On the day of the event, the visitor receives the route from home to the parking lot. Once you arrive, you can unlock the bicycles using the app. The bikes have the route to the event ready on the device attached to the bike. While cycling, you can listen to music from the artist you're going to see along with your concert buddy. You don't need to use your phone while cycling because there's a special device on the bike that shows the route and allows you to control the music. After the concert, you'll be guided back to your car.

                The biking routes shift the old situation to the new situation. Under this text you see the difference in where different cardinal directions will exit the highway. This way it will not be as busy at one exit as before. Because there are less traffic congestions and the crowd is spread in a more efficient way than before, thereâ€™s less emission than in the before situation.

                        The problem was this complex that I struggled to figure out where to start. I began by conducting insights from people that feel the consequences of the problem: talking to visitors, speaking with stakeholders, observing at concerts, and conducting a user trip. At some point, I decided it was time to move forward and start brainstorming solutions. Deciding when I knew enough was quite challenging. It felt like I could have continued for another 10 weeks, but by then, the project deadline would have already arrived.

                    <p>
                        I did notice that the research I had conducted was very useful. The target audience is very accustomed to their habits, so I wanted to find a soft spot to make an improvement. Many different solutions crossed my mind, but it was challenging to come up with a complete idea. That's why I then went back to the research results. For drivers, traffic jams are the biggest drawback, but this doesn't necessarily lead them to use public transportation. That's why I came up with a middle ground that, in theory, meets the requirements.

                        I tested my prototype in various ways. I simply conducted a one-on-one test of the app at a table. I tested the bike route guidance on an exercise bike in the gym to prevent accidents. The responses were enthusiastic. The pre-experience with the music completed the concept.
