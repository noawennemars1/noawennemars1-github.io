                    <h4>My studies</h4>
                    <p>
                        In 2019, as a 17-year-old student, I moved to the big city of Amsterdam. I come from a village in the eastern part of the country. Nervous and excited, I began my studies in Communication and Multimedia Design at the Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences. I chose these studies because it aligned with my hobbies. However, I found myself doing very little related to my hobbies during the studies, graphic design and illustrating. I discovered that I enjoy working on User Experience Design and Research the most. What I particularly like about this field is speaking with users and stakeholders and collaborating to create things. Providing a sympathetic ear for users and stakeholders and take real action to drive change is what I like doing best. 
                    </p> 
                    <h4>Board member of my student association</h4> 
                    <p>
                        In the second year of my CMD program, I served on the board of the student association, IAM Core. As the Treasurer, I managed the finances, created budgets, and supervised two committees. It was an educational experience during which I learned how to organize and facilitate events.

                    <h4>My hobbies</h4>
                    <p>
                        In my spare time, you can find me at the gym. I engage in strength training with friends about 3 to 5 times a week. Additionally, I enjoy going for walks, attempting to read occasionally, and often trying out new hobbies. Recently, I tried diamond painting, which I must say is very relaxing and definitely worth a try.
                    </p> 
                    <h4>
                        My character
                    </h4> 
                    <p>
                        Describing oneself is always challenging, but I've done my best to provide you with a good picture. I believe my strengths lie in communication, strategic thinking, and being eager to learn. When working in a team, I always strive to communicate effectively. Also, I value creating a strategic plan for how we approach tasks as a team. I also believe that working in teams offers great opportunities for learning. I enjoy observing how others tackle problems, create designs, and present their ideas. As a starting professional, I find this aspect crucial for personal growth. I'm also goal-oriented; I take pleasure in working towards a final result in the most efficient manner.  However, my character of course does have its flaws. I can still be insecure about the work I make. Knowing that I'm not the best at designing can make me doubt whether my work is comprehensive, accurate, or aesthetically pleasing enough. This is something I'm actively working on improving.
