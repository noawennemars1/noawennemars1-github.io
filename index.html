            <h2>About me</h2>
            <q>I value products that revolve all around the users needs, improve the world and make life easier. That’s what design is for.</q>
            <section>
                <p>In 2019 I began my studies in Communication and Multimedia Design at the Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences. I discovered that I enjoy working on User Experience Design and Research the most. What I particularly like about this field is speaking with users and stakeholders and collaborating to create designs. Providing a sympathetic ear for users and stakeholders and take real action to drive change is what I like doing best.</p>

                    <figcaption>Pictures of me during my studies.</figcaption> 
                </figure>
                <p>In the second year of my studies, I served on the board of the student association, IAM Core. As the Treasurer, I managed the finances, created budgets, made Instagram posts and supervised two committees. It was an educational experience during which I learned how to organize and facilitate events and gathered project management skills.</p>

                <h3>References</h3>
                <p>To give you a more complete picture of me as a colleague, I gathered some references from former colleagues.</p>
